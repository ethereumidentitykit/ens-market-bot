# QuickNode Sales Migration Plan

## Current State âœ… UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE â†’ ðŸš€ MOVING TO EVENT-DRIVEN
- **Sales**: Moralis + QuickNode â†’ Database â†’ Scheduler queries unposted â†’ tweets (UNIFIED)
- **Registrations**: Webhook stores to DB â†’ scheduler queries unposted â†’ tweets
- **Bids**: Magic Eden API polling â†’ stores to DB â†’ scheduler queries unposted â†’ tweets

**All three systems now use the same database-first architecture!**

## Next Evolution: Event-Driven Real-Time Processing
**Target Architecture:**
- **Sales**: Moralis/QuickNode â†’ Database â†’ PostgreSQL NOTIFY â†’ Instant Processing âš¡
- **Registrations**: Webhook stores to DB â†’ scheduler queries unposted â†’ tweets (unchanged)
- **Bids**: Magic Eden API polling â†’ stores to DB â†’ scheduler queries unposted â†’ tweets (unchanged)

## Goal
Migrate sales to real-time QuickNode webhooks while keeping existing scheduler and code structure.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: QuickNode Webhook Implementation

#### 1.1 Data Processing Pipeline
- **Webhook Endpoint**: Enhance existing `/webhook/salesv2` to handle Seaport events
- **Event Parsing**: Extract sale data from QuickNode orderFulfilled events
  - Parse `offer` array for ENS token details (contract + tokenId)
  - Parse `consideration` array for payment amounts (sum all ETH payments)
  - Extract buyer (`recipient`) and seller (`offerer`) addresses
  - Get transaction hash and block number

#### 1.2 Data Enrichment Steps
- **USD Pricing**: Integrate USD price API for ETH â†’ USD conversion
- **ENS Metadata**: Call OpenSea API for NFT name, image, and description
- **Marketplace Detection**: Map Seaport contract to "seaport" marketplace
- **Price Calculation**: Sum all consideration amounts for total sale price
- **Wei Conversion**: Convert wei amounts to ETH decimal format

#### 1.3 Filtering & Validation
- **Price Filtering**: Apply same 0.05 ETH minimum as current system
- **Contract Filtering**: Only process ENS NameWrapper and OG Registry contracts
- **Duplicate Detection**: Check `isSaleProcessed(tokenId)` before storing
- **Data Validation**: Ensure required fields (tokenId, addresses, price) are present

#### 1.4 Database Storage
- **Schema Compatibility**: Store in existing `processed_sales` table
- **Field Mapping**: Map QuickNode data to existing ProcessedSale interface
- **Status Setting**: Store with `posted: false` for scheduler pickup
- **Error Handling**: Log and skip malformed events

### Phase 2: Scheduler Integration âœ… COMPLETED

#### 2.1 Unified Database-First Processing âœ…
- **Step 1**: Moralis stores sales in database (no immediate posting)
- **Step 2**: Scheduler queries `getUnpostedSales()` for all sources (Moralis + QuickNode)
- **Step 3**: AutoTweetService processes unified sales with club filtering
- **Step 4**: Database `posted` field updated after successful Twitter posts
- **Race Protection**: Existing `isProcessingSales` lock prevents concurrent runs
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Fixed critical race condition with proper database updates

#### 2.2 Enhanced Logging
- **Duplicate Detection**: Log when Moralis finds QuickNode-processed sales
- **Performance Metrics**: Track QuickNode vs Moralis timing differences
- **Data Quality**: Log any enrichment failures or missing data
- **Processing Stats**: Monitor both ingestion sources separately

### Phase 3: Validation & Monitoring

#### 3.1 Data Quality Validation
- **Price Accuracy**: Compare QuickNode vs Moralis price calculations
- **Metadata Completeness**: Verify OpenSea API provides adequate NFT data
- **USD Conversion**: Validate USD pricing accuracy against Moralis
- **Missing Sales**: Monitor for any sales missed by QuickNode filtering

#### 3.2 Performance Monitoring
- **Latency Tracking**: Measure webhook processing time vs Moralis polling delay
- **Success Rate**: Track successful vs failed enrichment attempts
- **API Reliability**: Monitor OpenSea API and USD pricing service uptime
- **Duplicate Rate**: Measure how often QuickNode beats Moralis (success metric)

### Phase 4: Gradual Migration

#### 4.1 Moralis Frequency Reduction
- **Step 1**: Reduce Moralis polling from 5min â†’ 10min
- **Step 2**: Further reduce to 15min â†’ 30min
- **Step 3**: Move to 1-hour safety net polling
- **Monitoring**: Ensure no sales are missed during each step

#### 4.2 QuickNode Reliability Testing
- **Webhook Uptime**: Monitor for any QuickNode delivery failures
- **Data Completeness**: Verify all expected sales are captured
- **Error Recovery**: Test system behavior during QuickNode outages
- **Rollback Readiness**: Maintain ability to restore Moralis frequency

### Phase 5: Event-Driven Real-Time Architecture

#### 5.1 Database Event System Implementation
- **PostgreSQL Triggers**: Auto-create database triggers on app startup for new sale notifications
- **Database Event Listener**: New service to listen for PostgreSQL NOTIFY events on new sales
- **Smart Queuing System**: Queue all notifications immediately, process sequentially with rate limiting
- **Batch Handling**: Handle multiple simultaneous sales (e.g., 3-10 from Moralis scheduler) efficiently
- **Zero Database Migration**: No schema changes required, fully backward compatible setup
- **Auto-Setup**: Trigger creation handled automatically on application startup

#### 5.2 Scheduler Architecture Split
- **Modified Sales Scheduler**: Simplified to only fetch from Moralis REST API and store in database
- **Removed Batch Processing**: Scheduler no longer handles tweet posting - only data ingestion
- **Event-Driven Posting**: All tweet posting move to database event listener for instant processing
- **Unified Processing Path**: Single AutoTweetService handles all sales regardless of source
- **Maintained Safety**: 5-minute Moralis fetch continues as reliable background data source

#### 5.3 Real-Time Processing Benefits
- **QuickNode Sales**: Instant posting within 1-2 seconds of webhook receipt
- **Moralis Sales**: Instant posting when 5-minute scheduler stores new sales in database
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple sales (3-10 from Moralis) queued and processed immediately without waiting
- **Sequential Rate Limiting**: Maintains existing 20-second delays between tweets while processing continuously
- **No Lost Sales**: Queue system ensures all notifications are captured and processed in order
- **Single Code Path**: All sales processed through same AutoTweetService with consistent filtering
- **Robust Connection Management**: Auto-reconnecting database listener with health checks
- **Graceful Degradation**: If listener fails, sales remain in database for manual processing
